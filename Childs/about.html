                <h2>Background and Transition to IT</h2>
                <p> I began my academic journey with a strong foundation in Hydrology, earning a Master's degree in Quantitative Hydrology with a specialization in Mathematical Modeling of Surface Water Flows. My pursuit of excellence led me to France, where I was awarded a prestigious scholarship from the University of Limoges to complete a Master's in Science and Technology with a focus on Water Quality and Treatment. Although this program was designed to lead to a PhD, I transitioned into the professional world, working as a Math, Science, and Computer Science instructor in various high schools and vocational training centers in France. </p> <p> While excelling as an educator, I discovered my passion for Data Science and began teaching myself the field. This self-driven learning ignited a career shift, and I fully embraced the world of technology, transforming my expertise in education and science into a thriving profession in Data Science and IT. </p>

                <h2>Start as a Data Scientist</h2>
                <p> My career as a Data Scientist began as an Independent Trainer, teaching Python, R, Shiny and SQL to individuals and organizations. As a Freelance Consultant, I have successfully delivered impactful projects across diverse industries such as Energy, Agri-food Industry, Finance, collaborating with renowned multinational companies like EDF (Electricité de France), Danone, and FINTECH4ESG. </p> <p> Throughout these missions, I have leveraged tools from the Python and R ecosystems, developed predictive models using Machine Learning, and specialized in designing and deploying data-driven applications with R Shiny. My work is characterized by a results-driven approach, combining technical expertise with strategic insights to solve complex challenges and deliver high-impact solutions. </p>

                <h2>Passion for Data Applications and R Shiny Development</h2>
                <p>
                    When I discovered R Shiny, it was love at first sight. For me, R Shiny is one of those rare tools that empowers data professionals to bring their insights to life and create tangible value. My journey with R Shiny began after taking a course on portfolio analysis in finance. Inspired, I developed a web application that enables portfolio managers to create, analyze, and optimize stock portfolios with just a few clicks. This interactive tool, complete with visualizations, statistics, and optimization features, proved to be a transformative experience and is showcased in the "Portfolio" section of my work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project was a turning point. Since then, I have developed numerous R Shiny applications and even authored a book dedicated to mastering R Shiny. These apps have enabled businesses to automate processes, streamline reporting, and integrate predictive machine learning models into user-friendly interfaces. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to R Shiny, I leverage other frameworks like Streamlit, Dash, and PyShiny (Shiny for Python) for developing advanced data products. My expertise extends to tools like Quarto, R Markdown, Flexdashboard, and Shinydashboard, which I use to create high-impact dashboards and reports. Whether automating workflows or designing tailored applications, I am driven by a passion for transforming complex data into actionable solutions that drive business value.

                <h2>Continuous Learning and Teaching</h2>
                <p>
                    I have a deep passion for continuous learning, which is reflected in my commitment to staying ahead in the ever-evolving world of technology and data. Over the years, I have completed hundreds of online courses and continue to actively pursue new ones. I regularly watch YouTube videos on tech trends and data-related topics, and I am an avid reader of both digital and print books. Subscribed to platforms like O'Reilly, Datacamp, and Coursera, I engage in constant upskilling and stay informed about the latest advancements. This dedication to learning has significantly enhanced my ability to deliver exceptional results in my projects, often exceeding deadlines and client expectations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For me, the best way to solidify knowledge is by teaching it to others. Sharing concepts with others not only helps me deepen my understanding but also fuels my passion for knowledge transfer. This philosophy inspired me to author multiple books and launch a YouTube channel, where I document my learning journey and share insights with a growing audience of over 13,000 subscribers and more than 500 videos. Through my channel, I cover topics ranging from programming to data science and application development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond YouTube, I regularly share educational content on LinkedIn to reach a broader professional audience. I have also established a WhatsApp group dedicated to knowledge exchange and professional development in data science. Teaching has become an integral part of my career, allowing me to create impactful learning experiences for thousands while continuously expanding my own expertise. This synergy of learning and teaching is a cornerstone of my professional success and personal fulfillment.
